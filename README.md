# üéØ Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning

## üìå Project Overview  
This project uses machine learning models to accurately **predict which customers are likely to churn**, enabling businesses to proactively intervene and **minimize revenue loss**. The approach combines rigorous **data preprocessing**, **exploratory analysis**, **multiple classification models**, and **model interpretability** to deliver insights and actionable outcomes.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Build robust predictive models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to classify churn vs. retention.
- Address **class imbalance** through resampling techniques like **SMOTE, SMOTE-ENN**, or under/oversampling methods.  
- Provide **explainable AI** via interpretation methods (e.g., SHAP values) to identify the most influential churn-driving features.
- Deliver meaningful metrics and visualizations to assess performance and support business decisions.

## üìÅ Data Description

- **Source**: Public datasets commonly used for churn prediction, such as the **Telco Customer Churn** dataset.
- **Features** may include:
  - Customer demographics: tenure, contract type, service usage  
  - Billing: monthly charges, total charges  
  - Services: availability of addons (voice mail, streaming, etc.)
  - Churn flag (`Yes`/`No`) as the target variable  

- **Class Imbalance**: Churn instances typically constitute a small fraction of the data‚Äînecessitating resampling techniques.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Python**, with modules:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation
  - `scikit-learn` for ML modeling and metrics
  - **XGBoost / LightGBM** for powerful gradient boosting classifiers
  - **SHAP** for explainable AI and feature impact analysis
- **Visualization**: `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` for EDA and results plotting
- Optional: **Flask** for model deployment; **Docker** for containerization

## üß† Methodology

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Assess data distribution and imbalance
- Identify correlations, feature distributions, churn-related patterns

### 2. **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
- Clean missing or inconsistent data
- Encode categorical variables (one-hot or label encoding)
- Normalize and scale numerical features
- Handle class imbalance with SMOTE / SMOTE-ENN or similar techniques

### 3. **Model Training & Selection**
- Train multiple classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Perform **hyperparameter tuning** via GridSearch or cross-validation
- Evaluate models using metrics like **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**, and **AUC-ROC**

### 4. **Interpretability**
- Use **SHAP values** to visualize the impact of each feature on model predictions
- Identify key churn predictors (e.g., tenure, monthly charges, number of s
### 5. **Results & Evaluation**
- Compare model performance, prioritize high recall and balanced precision
- Present final confusion matrix, ROC curves, and feature importance plots

## üìà Expected Results

| Metric             | Typical Performance           |
|--------------------|------------------------------|
| Accuracy           | ~85‚Äì90%                      |
| ROC-AUC            | ~0.90+ (strong classifiers)  |
| F1-Score (Churn class) | ~0.75‚Äì0.85                |

- **Recall** for churn detection is prioritized to minimize false negatives.
- **SHAP analysis** helps visualize top drivers of churn, offering insights for retention strategies.

## üí° Business Impact

- Early prediction of at-risk customers allows for **targeted engagement strategies** and **resource-efficient retention campaigns**.
- Explainability helps customer success teams **understand ‚Äúwhy‚Äù churn is happening** and tailor interventions.
- The model serves as a foundational framework for cross-sell, upsell, and personalized retention strategies.

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- Integrate advanced models like **XGBoost** or **LightGBM** with improved performance via resampling & tuning.
- Deploy as a web service using **Flask** or **FastAPI**, packaged with **Docker** for easy setup.
- Implement real-time **scoring pipelines**, A/B testing, or backtesting for retention strategy effectiveness.
- Add **time-based features**, customer lifetime value estimators, or cross-domain behavioral inputs.
